# Overview

I am continually learning more about building efficient and easy to use software. I have started this project to learn more about making games.

I wrote a 2-player chess game. It is meant to follow the standard rules of chess. You play the game with two people by assigning each person a piece color and then take turns moving pieces. The object of the game is to trap the other player's king (♔/♚) so that his current space as well as any space he has access to is also a potential capture space of one of your own pieces.

I wrote this project to gain some experience making games and to guage how much I enjoy making them.
